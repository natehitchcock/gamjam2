### Overview
    Twin stick shooter 

    -Roguelike
    -Hub world
    -Randomly generated levels
    -Lovecraftian theme (maybe dreams, where the twist is that you become a great old one at the end of the game)

### Other mechanics to explore
    -Exapnding the hub world
        -By mining things with your gun
        -By collecting mob drops (I don't like this idea as much)
    -Maybe the gun is more of a "magic catalyst" than a projectile thrower 
    -Beating a run let's you save an item into your 'on start' build
    -Each world you visit is filled with a subset of items decided at generation, Each item is embellished with a subset pf special effects also decided at generation time
        -Items can be
            -Poitions - short term radical effects, potions can be drunk multiple times
            -Scrolls - long term effects (per floor? per run?)
            -Artifacts - permanent effects as long as they exist in inventory, maybe requiring activation or certain activation situations to occur (on health loss, on item consume, on bullet fired)
            -Consumables - Explosives, thrown weapons, etc
        -Effects could be
            -Simple elemental damage on target, or AOE around player
            -Turning enemies
            -Repulse/attract objects
            -Shielding
            -Vamp health/mana/ammo/exp/level
                ?Should enemies also have leveling curves? 
            -Explode corpse
            -Summon ally
            -Summon enemy? (what use could that be?)
            -Summon neutral actor? (inter-level allegiences?)
            -Give health/bullets/exp
            -Give stat bonuses

    1) Praying to the Elder Gods for different buffs. We could allow players to encounter horrific monuments of tribute to learn the prayers. 
    Questions: 
        -Should you be allowed multiple different prayers at once? 
        -How many times do you get to pray?(Estus Flask, anyone?)
        -Should they swap out like Enter The Gungeon's actives?
