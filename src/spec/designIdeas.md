### Overview
    Twin stick shooter 

    -Roguelike
    -Hub world
    -Randomly generated levels
    -Lovecraftian theme (maybe dreams, where the twist is that you become a great old one at the end of the game)

### Other mechanics to explore
    -Exapnding the hub world
        -By mining things with your gun
        -By collecting mob drops (I don't like this idea as much)
    -Beating a run let's you save an item into your 'on start' build

    1) Praying to the Elder Gods for different buffs. We could allow players to encounter horrific monuments of tribute to learn the prayers. 
    Questions: 
        -Should you be allowed multiple different prayers at once? 
        -How many times do you get to pray?(Estus Flask, anyone?)
        -Should they swap out like Enter The Gungeon's actives?
