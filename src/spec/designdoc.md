Name = Iod

#Narrative: 
    You are branded, the mark of Iod carved in your flesh. It serves as a contract with Iod, the embrance of death being withheld from ever truly taking you. For what purpose? When will the madness end? 

alt
    Seared by the scalding brand of Iod, the Shining Hunter-God, death eludes your thirsty soul.
    For what sickly fortune does he keep your torment alive?

### Tag lines

    Did you choose Iod, or did madness choose you?

### Melee thoughts
    To make melee more appealing, maybe we use it to deal 'crazy (?maddening, haha)' effects 
    e.g. Life steal, poison, hit => explode, hit => turn on their allies,
    kills => drop weak passive bonus items, kills => turn to stone (to provide cover)
    hit => chain lightning, kills => calls in 'orbital strike'

    thematically, these could all be sacraficial daggers that are appealing to one god or
    another
